Use the rubric given below as your basis in doing this activity. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. A. Justin was always prepared. His motto was “Never throw anything out, you never know when it might come in handy.” His bedroom was so full of flat bicycle tires, bent tennis rackets, deflated basketballs, and games with missing pieces that you could barely get in the door. His parents pleaded with him to clean out his room.“What use is a fish tank with a hole in the bottom?” his father asked. But Justin simply smiled and repeated his motto, “Never throw anything out, you never know when it might come in handy.”1. What approach will you use to evaluate the text?

A crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last, he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.1.

Between eight and nine o’clock in the morning. A dark leaden-coloredmass is creeping over the sky towards the sun. Red zigzags of lightning gleam here and there across it. There is a sound of far-away rumbling. A warm wind frolics over the grass, bends the trees, and stirs up the dust. In a minute there will be a spurt of May rain and a real storm will begin.

</p><p>Air pollution is one of the greatest scourges of our day, not only because of its contribution to global warming but also because of its effect on public and personal health due to increased sickness and death. Many contaminants are significant contributors to infectious diseases. Pollution is defined as the movement of risks associated with exposure to people as well as other living creatures into the surroundings. Human emissions pollute the water we consume, the environment in which we live, and the soil in which plants are grown, all of which have a harmful effect on the environment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Natural disasters, as well as climate change caused by pollution, have an impact on the geographical spread of many infectious diseases.
