                                            a The Philippines is known as the festive capital of the world. Every place in the country has a festival of its own. As such, every 30th of April, Lopezenos celebrates the "Pamaypayan Festival" as its annual festival celebrating its good harvest and a year full of blessings. It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</a>

                                            The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives.

It is where shoppers search among racks of various items, hoping for a good find - that is, a product for which you "pay less for more." An ukay-ukay is the perfect place for thrifty buyers who are on a tight budget to shop for goods. It sells low-priced secondhand products of well-known brands or in most cases, cheap imitations of the original.Many ukay-ukay stores dot the streets, especially near dry and wet markets or palengkes, Although, the most popular places where many ukay- ukay vendors gather are Divisoria, Greenhils, and Cartimar. Meanwhile, ukay- ukay depots, where most vendors buy their goods, are located in Bambang in Manila, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Baguio. Ukay-ukay goods are bought in bulk from retailers and traders. For instance, one bundle of clothes usually contains hundreds of clothing items. Each individual item is then priced by the seller. Buying in bulk allows sellers to set a low and affordable base price for products.In many cases, the number of competitors in the area can also influence ne pricing. To stay relevant to customers' preferences, vendors tend to set the rice of their goods to equal that of their competitors. Another common actice in flea markets is the tawad or the practice of haggling for a lower price. stomers and vendors often engage in haggling, and this results in a reduction price by about 10 to 30 percent. Some vendors anticipate this practice and their prices at a higher ceiling.Ukay-ukay stores have become a cheaper option compared to regular ail stores which sell the original goods at a higher price. These stores have med a unique market which caters to the needs and preferences of the nary masses and customers who wish to cut costs by buying cheaper items.1.

Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</a>

                            18. The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest.

In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production.

Usage Rates
You might have a large audience of customers using your products, but in different levels or frequencies. In this case, usage rates might be your ideal market segmentation strategy. With this approach, you identify customers who use the product infrequently, those who are routine or regular users, those who are die-hard loyal customers and those who haven't tried the product. When you market, you either attempt to present the benefits of the product as it relates to usage levels, or you try to increase a buyer's consumption. For instance, Clorox often targets infrequent and routine users with ads promoting all of the uses of bleach to ramp up buying activity.
Price Impact
Price typically plays a key role in identifying the right segment for your products. If you develop a high-quality solution and intend to provide elite service, your customers probably would come from middle to upper class income levels. If you emphasize price or value as part of your offering, you have a larger pool of budget-conscious buyers in the lower, lower-middle or middle income classes.</h2><br />
                        Usage rates, dito nalalaman kung gaano kadalas ginagamit ng customer yung product.Yung Price Impact, dapat katumbas nung quality yung pricing. Kung maganda yung quality ng product at service, asahan mong makahihikayat ka ng mga customers. (based on my understanding :) )<br /><br /><br />
