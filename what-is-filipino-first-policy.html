                                            The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economicslowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into povertyreduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean newopportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with therest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are morelikely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive.This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It also investigateswhy poverty reduction has been historically lack lustre in the Philippines using available panel datathat provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. Itpointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher incomegrowth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide into poverty. This suggests thatgovernment should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments toassist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.1) what is the main idea of the text?2) does the text provide supporting details? cite two details.3) does the text provide credible detail? explain briefly.4) does the text have any relevance to you? in what way?5) do you agree with the author's idea? explain briefly.​</a>

                                            -Pa summarize poThe Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks. ​</a>

Even though the government warns about its danger, cigarette addiction is not only observed in adults but in teenagers too. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tobacco Survey, around 15.9 million Filipinos aged 15 years and above smoke tobacco cigarette. About 47 percent male and 9 percent female are smoke-users. The implementation of Executive Order (E.O) No. 26 also known as "Anti-Smoking Law" is timely. This policy prohibits smoking in all public and enclosed places nationwide. The increasing number of smokers in open areas is alarming. Smoking is one of the causes of deaths in our country. Researches tell that 70% of smokers suffer from lung cancer. It has horrible side effects that may lead to asthma, heart diseases and loss of lives. Second-hand smokers may endure worse health risks than first-hand smokers. Authorities must strictly enforce this law and strengthen penalties to ensure our well-being. The violators regardless of their social status should pay fines ranging from P500 to P10,000 and based from the number of offenses. Tobacco excise tax hike may be implemented to lessen the population of smokers and discourage the students from using it. The high price of the tobacco products may repel the users in buying it and can save their lives. 1. What is the article about? 2. What is the problem mentioned in the first paragraph? 3.

______________1. Ice cream is a delicious frozen treat that comes in many various
colors and flavors. Two of my favorites ice cream are mango and
chocolate. Both taste great inside a milk a shake. However,
mango tastes a bit sour that makes it taste more unique than
chocolate that taste purely sweet.
_____________2. Pandesal is one of the favorite breakfast of Filipinos together
with hot coffee. Preparing it is easy. Just follow the simple steps.
First, in a big bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Second, pour
in milk, beaten egg, and melted butter. Add also the instant dry
yeast and knead until a sticky dough forms. Third, form the
dough into a ball and lightly coat with oil, then roll with bread
crumbs. Lastly, bake the prepared dough in preheat oven with
185 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes. Now, you have a hot
pandesal.
_____________3. Playing a video game becomes a problem among the teenagers.
This is due to excessive or limitless usage that leads to addiction
and suffer detrimental effects like isolation of oneself and
withdrawal from social experiences.
____________4. Bullying is one of the concerns that exist in schools. Bullying can
cause long-term harmful mental effects on a victim of a bully. A
victim of bully may end fear retaliation, and unable to cope

educate all pupils from dangers and effects of bullying and
establish school policies regarding bullying. They also provide
parenting to have a clear understanding of what constitutes
bullying policies in school. Likewise, counselling is in need if ever
it happens to the children.

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</a>

                                            Text A The national government first imposed the face shield requirement in December 2020, in addition to wearing face masks in public. Moreno has earlier criticized the use of face shields, saying it is an additional financial burden for Filipinos yet it does not provide people full protection against COVID-19 citing scientific studies abroad. On the other hand, Dr. Leachon, a health reform advocate, echoed the DOH's position on the use of face shields, saying that "there's absolutely science to prove that face shields can be beneficial as an extra layer of protection." Meanwhile, the public clamor for a policy review intensifies. At the very least, they are asking the government to make a clear - and firm recommendation for or against the use of face shields. - Questions: 1. What is the issue presented on the given text? 2.

Filipinos need prudence only when venturing within the EEZ of China
and the other countries around the South China Sea.
This accommodation brought the COVID pestilence to the country in the
early days of the pandemic.
While the two countries have long-standing friendly ties, it’s time to
reassess a policy that smacks of capitulation.

Garcia's administration. Patrimonial interests attempted to exploit the Filipino First policy but relied on the bank for foreign exchange. In such a setting, how could the Central Bank lead economic policy making and become an island of state strength? This article examines this puzzle by analyzing the process that involved politicians, private sector leaders, and even the American government. It argues that the Central Bank supported Filipino First only until it could achieve its policy goal of economic decolonization.</p><p></p><p>Journal Information</p><p>Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints is an internationally refereed journal that publishes scholarly articles and other materials on the history of the Philippines and its peoples, both in the homeland and overseas.

Even though the government warns about its danger, cigarette addiction is not only observed in adults but in teenagers too. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Tobacco Survey, around 15.9 million Filipinos aged 15 years and above smoke tobacco cigarette. About 47 percent male and 9 percent female are smoke-users. The implementation of Executive Order (E.O) No. 26 also known as "Anti-Smoking Law" is timely. This policy prohibits smoking in all public and enclosed places nationwide. The increasing number of smokers in open areas is alarming. Smoking is one of the causes of deaths in our country. Researches tell that 70% of smokers suffer from lung cancer. It has horrible side effects that may lead to asthma, heart diseases and loss of lives. Second-hand smokers may endure worse health risks than first-hand smokers. Authorities must strictly enforce this law and strengthen penalties to ensure our well-being. The violators regardless of their social status should pay fines ranging from P500 to P10,000 and based from the number of offenses. Tobacco excise tax hike may be implemented to lessen the population of smokers and discourage the students from using it. The high price of the tobacco products may repel the users in buying it and can save their lives. 1. What is the article about? 2. What is the problem mentioned in the first paragraph? 3.

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</h2><br />

                            22. Text A The national government first imposed the face shield requirement in December 2020, in addition to wearing face masks in public. Moreno has earlier criticized the use of face shields, saying it is an additional financial burden for Filipinos yet it does not provide people full protection against COVID-19 citing scientific studies abroad. On the other hand, Dr. Leachon, a health reform advocate, echoed the DOH's position on the use of face shields, saying that "there's absolutely science to prove that face shields can be beneficial as an extra layer of protection." Meanwhile, the public clamor for a policy review intensifies. At the very least, they are asking the government to make a clear - and firm recommendation for or against the use of face shields. - Questions: 1. What is the issue presented on the given text? 2.
